Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning to classify whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using diagnostic data.


PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
To build a reliable classification model that can assist in early detection of breast cancer based on medical data.
